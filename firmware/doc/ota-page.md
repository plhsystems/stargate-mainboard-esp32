# OTA

This page provide a way for the user to upload a new firmware and audio-assets.

## Upgrade firmware

The system can validate the binary file by itself to avoid corrupting the system.

A button to upload a new firmware.

It will also display the upload progression and error if there is any.
It will display the current version and firmware SHA256.

## Upload audio assets

Not yet defined how it will be done.
Perhaps a single binary file or a zip file.

But the system can works normally without the audio assets, it's just boring without sound.
