# Mainboard Firmware

The project goal is to make a fully functional Stargate (designed by Kristian) by using an ESP32 instead of the raspberry pi.

## Why? 

The ESP32 is cheap when compared to a raspberry pi and more accessible. Everything the raspberry pi does to control the Stargate can be done with cheaper hardware.
Also the mainboard will integrate all necessary drivers, IC, regulator, etc. in a single PCB.
