# Stargate type

There are 4 types of Stargate supported by the mainboard.

## Movie

In the movie, every single chevrons move to lock a glyph.
The ring spin until it get aligned with a chevron, then it move to lock it, then the light turn on.

There is no chevron light effect in the movie, only in the serie. But the lightning effect is there anyway on the Kristian Gate.

## SG1

The SG1 gate is similar to the the movie version, except only the top-most master chevron move.
To dial, every glyph will get locked using the master chevron. Then every chevron light-up in sequence, starting with the one right of the master one, going clockwise.

## Atlantis

There are no physical spinning ring, every glyph location where the ring would normally be are screen, able to display any glyph.
