# Wizard

The step by step wizard is meant to help user to setup their Stargate for the first time.
The first time running the mainboard, the user should be redirected to it by default.
The user is free to go through the wizard or skip it or skip some steps.

For now we only support the 'Movie' gate mode.

## Stargate type (mandatory)

This step is mandatory, because it change how some input/output will react. 
The wizard will also be different based on this configuration.

## Setup Wi-Fi Station (optional) 

The user can setup the Wi-Fi station configuration.
Indicate the connected/disconnected status and IP address on the network.

Allows to check if a new software upgrade is available.
